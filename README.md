# GUI-Calculator
ACS Unit 3 Python Activity
Complete a Basic Calculator with GUI

### *Summary*
Now that you have finished a basic calculator, let’s up the design game by using the Tkinter module to create an interactive calculator program. The goal of this assignment is for you to implement a fully functional basic calculator that utilizes the four basic operations as well as an additional operation of your choosing. The calculator should operate as a hand-held one would. The display should only be a display for output, and the buttons should be the only means of entering information. In other words, no typing of numbers. Buttons should be included for:
- All 5 operations (4 basics and at least 1 more of your choice)
- Digits (0-9)
- Equals
- Decimal point
- Clear
- More by your choice

There should also be a **display**. Input by the user should be by button press only, and each press should result in an update to the display. 

### Step 1
Complete the user interface design. Be sure the layout is logical and meets the standard expectations for a calculator. Try to make it look good but don’t worry about odd spacing for now. Use the 'grid' geometry in tkinter. Take a screenshot of your completed user interface and upload it in Google classroom.

### Step 2
Functionality should be coded in using the same basic concepts from your previous calculator but taking into consideration the differences for a calculator run via user interface (i.e. number, operation, number, result). Hint, use your display window as a tool that can store information temporarily and be used to retrieve information.

### Step 3
Commit and Push the program (and any related files if there are any) to your repository on Github

### Step 4
Complete the questions listed in the assignment posted in Google Classroom

>Prompt 1: Describe how your program collects user input correctly and stores for use in calculations. First, copy and paste the segment of code that shows user data being collected and stored. Then explain how it works.

>Prompt 2: During development you likely ran into one or two issues with programming. Copy and paste a segment of code that gave you issues. Describe the challenge you faced and how you debugged the issue.

>Prompt 3: Give an example of how you manage user input to ensure that results are consistent with user expectations, based on physical calculator operations, and that errors are avoided.

>Prompt 4: Share an example of how your code manages potential errors such as division by zero, or other issues that may cause errors.
