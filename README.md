# GUI-Calculator
ACS Unit 3 Python Activity
Complete a Basic Calculator with GUI

### *Summary*
Now that you have finished a basic calculator, let’s up the design game by using the Tkinter module to create an interactive calculator program. The goal of this assignment is for you to implement a fully functional calculator that utilizes the four basic operations as well as an additional operation of your choosing.The calculator should operate as a handheld one would. Buttons should be included for:
- All 5 operations (4 basics and at least 1 more of your choice)
- Digits (all 10)
- Equals
- Decimal point
- Clear
- More by your choice

There should also be a **display**. Input by the user should be by button press (this is a challenge; typing an entry should be a last resort) and each press should result in an update to the display. 

### Step 1
Complete the user interface design. Be sure the layout is logical and meets the standard expectations for a calculator. Try to make it look good but don’t worry about odd spacing for now. Take a screenshot of your completed user interface and upload it in Google classroom. Recommend using the *grid* method

### Step 2
Functionality should be coded in using the same basic concepts from your previous calculator but taking into consideration the differences for a calculator run via user interface (i.e. number, operation, number, result). Hint, use your display window as a tool that can store information temporarily and be used to retrieve information.

### Step 3
Commit and Push the program (and any related files if there are any) to your repository on Github

### Step 4
Complete the questions listed in the assignment posted in Google Classroom

>Question 1: Describe how your program collects user input correctly and stores for use in calculations. First, copy and paste the segment of code that shows user data being collected and stored. Then explain how it works.

>Question 2: During development you likely ran into one or two issues with programming. Copy and paste a segment of code that gave you issues. Describe the challenge you faced and how you debugged the issue.
